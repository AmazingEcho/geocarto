## FGDC Cartographic Standard for Geologic Maps

... has always been available in [text formats](http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/fgdc_gds/geolsymstd.php)

... and is now available in [CartoCSS](http://www.mapbox.com/carto/api/2.1.0/)


This is useful if you want to make geologic maps in TileMill, which is useful if you think geologic maps should be pretty and online. I tried to be as true to the spec as possible, but its hard to be precise about dimensions in terms like "mm" when you're dealing with a variable-zoom map.

The `svg` folder contains .svg files that provide line-decoration markers and structural symbols. Notice that the files are named according to their respective FGDC symbol identifier.

## To Use this in TileMill:

1. __Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)__
2. __Download [TileMill](http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/)__
3. __Get some geologic map data__ into a format that TileMill can read. This includes ESRI Shapefiles, KML, GeoJSON, GeoTIFF, PostGIS, CSV, and SQLite. 
    - The one requirement presently is that your map data needs to have a "fgdc_key" column. This column should contain the FGDC symbol identifiers such as "1.1.1" for an accurate contact (solid black line). Aside from that, it doesn't matter how your data is structured.
4. __Clone this repository__ into the right place. Generally TileMill makes a "MapBox" directory in your "Documents" folder (on OSX and Windows, at least). Inside that directory is a "project" one. This is where your various TileMill projects live. Clone this repository into that `project` directory. For example, on OSX:

        cd /Users/ryan/Documents/MapBox/project
        git clone https://github.com/rclark/geocarto.git
        
5. __Setup a Project__ by running `node build-project.js`
6. __Open TileMill__ and there should be a "FGDC Symbols" project.
7. __Add your data__ to the project. It is important that you give your layers appropriate class names.
    - Give your lines the class name `geolines`
    - Give your points the class name `structurepoints`
    - Give your polygons the class name `geopolys`
    
*Note: the given polygon color will likely not be valid for your map. Take a look in the `polys` folder for ways you might be able to quickly generate your polygon symbology.*

## OR!
If you want to be simple about it, just make a TileMill project and copy some of my code into your own .mss files. Make sure to grab any .svg files for the FGDC symbol rules that you're using.

## If you want to Help

... and you should! I won't be able to completely finish this myself, and you'll inevitably find that there are symbols you want from the FGDC standard that haven't been written out here yet. Follow the [fork my repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) instructions provided by GitHub, make some changes, and then [make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Also, read these things:
- [About CartoCSS in general](http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/manual/carto/)
- [CartoCSS Reference](http://www.mapbox.com/carto/api/2.1.0/)
- [FGDC Standard](http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/fgdc_gds/geolsymstd.php)
- My Style-Guide (coming soon...)

If you're working with the FGDC symbol standard in some other system, keep in mind that the most time-consuming part of this project is getting the .svg files for point symbols and line decorations. If your workflow includes a step where you might be able to export .svg files, do it, and ship them over to me! I'll be really grateful.
